# Hello World, I'm Sean!! ðŸŒŽ ðŸ‘‹

I'm web developer and overall programmer that strives to create amazing, reusable and scalable code. I had a love and interest in coding ever since I was a child, seeing a family member use a chat window to talk to someone in another country and wondering how it was possible. That curiousity led to a life of programming, and I love every minute of it!
