# Hello World, I'm Sean!! ðŸŒŽ ðŸ‘‹

<img src="./images/banner.jpg" alt="Profile Pic">

I'm web developer and overall programmer that strives to create amazing, reusable and scalable code. I had a love and interest in coding ever since I was a child, seeing a family member use a chat window to talk to someone in another country and wondering how it was possible. That curiousity led to a life of programming, and I love every minute of it!

Technologies I've used include: C#, ASP .Net, HTML5, SASS/CSS, Javascript, Typescript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Lucene, T-SQL
